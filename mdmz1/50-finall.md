## 50. final

Alhamdulillah, I finished writing this book while in the hospital with my daughter. It was quite difficult. In sha Allah everything will be fine. O Allah, Lord of the Worlds, give strength to my daughter.        

Why is the book called that? **MD** - means **M**alware **D**evelopment, The **MZ** signature is a signature used by the MS-DOS relocatable 16-bit EXE format and its still present in today's PE files for backwards compatibility., also **MD MZ** means **M**y **D**aughter **M**unira **Z**hassulankyzy.    

I will be very happy if this book helps at least one person to gain knowledge and learn the science of cybersecurity. The book is mostly practice oriented.     

All examples are practical cases for educational purposes only.      
Thanks for your time happy hacking and good bye!
