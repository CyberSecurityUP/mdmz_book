## 2. what is malware development?

Whether you are a Red Team or Blue Team specialist, learning the techniques and tricks of malware development gives you the most complete picture of advanced attacks. Also, due to the fact that most (classic) malwares are written under Windows, as a rule, this gives you tangible knowledge of developing under Windows.

Most of the tutorials in this book require a deep understanding of the `Python` and `C/C++` programming languages:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

The book is divided into three logical chapters:    
- Malware development tricks and techniques    
- AV evasion tricks    
- Persistence techniques    

All material in the book is based on posts from my [blog](https://cocomelonc.github.io/)
